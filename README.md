# MY PORTFOLIO 
### ABOUT MYSELF

- I am 19 years old, my pronouns are he/him. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems, where I enjoy the challenge of mastering new programming languages and solving complex problems. My program inspires me to push my boundaries and continuously learn. Outside of my studies, I joined a photography group and worked as a graphic designer, where I enhanced my creative and technical skills. These experiences have sharpened my attention to detail and taught me how to communicate visually. I’m ambitious, hard-working, and passionate about technology, and I’m excited to apply my skills in meaningful ways as I continue to grow in the field.
